#Build DFA using HTML and Javascript
DFA stands for Deterministic Finite Automata. This programm allows the users to input its DFA to the programm and then check for different strins as whether 
the string reaches the accepting state of the DFA or not. The DFA is input by feeding the no of states, the transition matrix and the finish states.
Run the main file. Add the details as prompted and test for different input strings.
